Pseudocode

algorithm 1:

User inputs number of rows (n) and number of events/columns (m)

Check if the user input satifies the conditions
where n is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 5

if so, create P_board otherwise try again

for x = 0 to n
  for y = 0 to m
    get users to input event values
